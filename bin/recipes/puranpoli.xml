			<SUMMARY>Puran Poli</SUMMARY>
			<INGREDIENT>
2 cups chana dal, soaked in water for 4 hours\n
2 cups jaggery (adjust for sweetness)\n
2 cups refined flour\n
3 tbsp oil\n
1 tsp cardamom powder\n
1/4th tsp nutmeg powder\n
1/4th tsp nutmeg powder\n
3/4 tsp turmeric powder
</INGREDIENT>
			<PROCEDURE>
Cook chana dal in a pressure cooker till it turns soft. 

Drain out excess water until the dal is absolutely becomes dry.

Add jaggery and cook further and then mash into a soft paste.

Add cardamom powder, saffron, and freshly grated nutmeg powder and mix well. 

Form 20 balls of equal size and put it aside.

Mix refined flour, oil, water and turmeric powder. Make very soft, sticky dough. 

Knead very well. Use oil to knead. Divide into 20 equal portions.

With greased palms, take one portion of dough and flatten it into a disc of the size of the palm. 

Place a ball of "chana jaggery" paste in the centre and fold the disc from all sides to cover the paste completely.

On a well-floured board, better over a sheet of clean transparent plastic wrap, gently roll out each poli to a 6 inches disc.
 
This can get tricky as the paste does try to slide out. Use a little flour if that happens. Roll.

Roast each poli on a hot, dry girdle. Do not use oil or ghee. Roast both sides well. 

Smear with ghee on both sides when done. 

Serve warm with clarified butter or a bowl of milk.
